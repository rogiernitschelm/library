# Variables and Constants

## let vs var

Constants are declared with let and their values cannot be reassigned. Use
constants whenever possible.

Example:

    let PI = 3.14159265359
    PI = 4 // error

    var fun = true
    fun = false

## Declaration

Example:

    Explicit and inferred:

    let PI: Double = 3.14159265359
    let PI = 3.14159265359

    Multiple:

    let PI = 3.14, birth_date = '16-01-1985', gender = 'male'
