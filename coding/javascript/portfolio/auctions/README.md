# Auction template

## Structure

This is my auction site. It uses an Express.js back-end, GraphQL
middleware and a React front-end with Apollo. In addition I use redux-form for
easy form handling.

## Use

Starting the server:

    ```bash
    cd server
    yarn run validation && yarn run dev
    ```

Starting the client:

    ```bash
    cd client
    yarn run dev
    ```

Graphiql for playing around:

    localhost:3000/graphql

Testing the server

    ```bash
    cd server
    yarn run test
    ```
